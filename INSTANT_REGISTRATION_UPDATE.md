### 2. **Database Schema Updates**

#### PhotographerProfile Model:
```prisma
// Application Status
applicationStatus ApplicationStatus @default(APPROVED)  // Changed from PENDING
applicationDate   DateTime @default(now())
approvedAt        DateTime @default(now())              // Auto-approved
approvedBy        String? @default("SYSTEM")           // System approval
```

#### Key Changes:

### 4. **Favicon Addition**

#### Files Created:

- `public/favicon.ico` - ICO favicon (copy of SVG)
- Updated `pages/_document.tsx` with favicon links

#### Favicon Design:
- **Background**: Dark blue (#030213) matching brand

- **Format**: 16x16 SVG with ICO fallback

### 5. **User Experience Improvements**
